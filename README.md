# Time Series Forecasting with Amazon SageMaker

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a time series forecasting model using Amazon SageMaker. The goal is to predict stock prices, sales, or demand using SageMaker's built-in DeepAR algorithm. The project includes data collection, model training, and deployment, as well as visualization of forecasted results.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Historical time series data is collected from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`.
- **Model Training**: A time series forecasting model is trained using SageMaker's DeepAR algorithm.
- **Deployment**: The trained model is deployed to a SageMaker endpoint for making predictions.
- **Visualization**: Results are visualized using Plotly or Streamlit, comparing historical data with forecasted values.

## Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: An active AWS account with appropriate permissions.
- **Python**: Python 3.6 or later.
- **AWS CLI**: Configured with your AWS credentials.
- **Boto3**: AWS SDK for Python.
- **SageMaker SDK**: AWS SageMaker Python SDK.
